      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next generation of AI Agents is not just smarter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They will be fundamentally different, Let me explain&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman in a recent Reddit AMA emphasized the popularity of AI Agents.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(Learn more here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lnkd.in/gzTFADZM&#34;&gt;https://lnkd.in/gzTFADZM&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These AI Agents can clearly accelerate the development of different fields.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is certain that their architecture will greatly differ from our current architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though we cannot exactly predict the future architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is my take on a possible architectural change within AI agents:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NHIỀU CÔNG CỤ HỌC TẬP ĐƯỢC TẠO RA TỪ VIBE CODING. Vd: app học nhạc chỉ dùng 1 prompt trên Gemini 2.5 Pro trong Google AI Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Build a tool to help me learn how music modalities work. Make it interactive and use a keyboard that plays sounds. Include a &amp;lsquo;quiz&amp;rsquo; mode. Make sure the code is in a single file.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(cre: Google AI Devs)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create a comprehensive, step-by-step guide detailing all available methods (both technical and non-technical) to scrape or crawl data from Facebook, including public and private data. A detailed, well-structured document or guide with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and examples. The guide should cover technical considerations, tools, techniques, and potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;advancing-agentic-knowledgeable-self-awareness-a-research-agenda-extending-arxiv250403553&#34;&gt;Advancing Agentic Knowledgeable Self-Awareness: A Research Agenda Extending arXiv:2504.03553&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of complex tasks necessitates mechanisms for robust and efficient knowledge utilization. A critical aspect of this is self-awareness regarding the agent&amp;rsquo;s own knowledge state – understanding what it knows, what it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, and when external information is required. The paper arXiv:2504.03553 introduces the concept of &amp;ldquo;agentic knowledgeable self-awareness&amp;rdquo; and proposes the &amp;ldquo;KnowSelf&amp;rdquo; method as a novel approach to instill this capability in language agents. KnowSelf utilizes special tokens and a two-stage training process to explicitly signal the agent&amp;rsquo;s perceived knowledge state and guide its information processing strategy (e.g., relying on internal parameters vs. seeking external knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ethical Intelligence</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ethical-intelligence-in-the-era-of-al-navigating-the-post-turing-landscape&#34;&gt;Ethical Intelligence in the Era of Al: Navigating the Post-Turing Landscape&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (Al) has ignited a global conversation about its potential benefits and inherent risks. The unease expressed by authors in London regarding the alleged unauthorized use of their work to train Al models underscores a growing concern within the creative ecosystem. This is not an isolated incident, but rather a symptom of a larger challenge: how to ethically integrate increasingly sophisticated Al into the fabric of our society, particularly within creative and political spheres where human values and rights are paramount. The deployment of Al in support of regimes committing atrocities further amplifies the urgency of establishing ethical boundaries for this powerful technology. It is no longer a question of whether unchecked Al will significantly impact these ecosystems, but rather how quickly and with what consequences. This paper will delve into the concept of &amp;ldquo;Ethical Intelligence&amp;rdquo; in the context of Al that is reaching, and in some interpretations, surpassing human-level conversational abilities, as symbolized by the Turing Test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
