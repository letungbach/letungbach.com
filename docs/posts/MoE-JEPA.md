# Research Proposal: MoE-JEPA World Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning and Planning

## Abstract

Current AI research emphasizes the development of sophisticated world models capable of understanding complex dynamics, particularly from video data, often leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) for representation extraction. Predictive models in abstract spaces (like JEPA) are gaining prominence over generative ones. Simultaneously, Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a way to scale neural network capacity efficiently. This proposal outlines a research approach combining these trends: developing an Action-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (MoE-JEPA) world model. This model will be pre-trained using self-supervision on large video datasets to learn robust visual representations and environment dynamics. The MoE structure will allow the model to efficiently capture diverse or multi-modal dynamics within an environment by routing inputs to specialized expert sub-networks. This sophisticated world model will then be integrated into a model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to enable efficient planning and decision-making for agents (e.g., robots) interacting with complex environments. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to more accurate world models, improved sample efficiency in RL, and better generalization across tasks compared to monolithic world models.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Intelligent agents capable of acting autonomously in the real world require a deep understanding of how their actions influence the environment. This understanding is often encapsulated in a "world model." Recent trends—highlighted by researchers like Yann LeCun [2]—emphasize predictive world models trained on video data using self-supervised learning. These models focus on predictions within an abstract representation space (e.g., JEPA) rather than pixel-level generation, thus learning generalizable features for downstream planning tasks.

Real-world dynamics are complex, non-stationary, and multi-modal, making it challenging for a single monolithic network to capture such diversity. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, which dynamically activate specialized expert networks based on input [3][4], offer a promising solution. This proposal bridges the concepts by developing a novel Action-Conditioned MoE-JEPA world model that integrates advanced SSL techniques, efficient expert routing, and model-based RL.

## 2. Literature Review

This section summarizes key literature that forms the foundation of the proposed research:

- **World Models**: World models are internal representations learned by agents to simulate and predict environmental dynamics. Pioneering work by Schmidhuber and later extensions by Ha & Schmidhuber laid the groundwork for predictive models that can forecast future states based on current inputs [1].

- **Self-Supervised Learning for Vision**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for representation learning, especially in vision. Techniques such as contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) and non-contrastive methods (e.g., BYOL, SimSiam) have shown the ability to learn powerful representations from unlabeled data. JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) extends these ideas by focusing on the prediction of future or masked representations in an abstract embedding space, aligning with the vision outlined by LeCun [2].

- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: MoE architectures, as introduced by Shazeer et al. and further developed by Fedus et al., leverage multiple expert networks alongside a gating mechanism to route inputs efficiently. This approach scales model capacity while keeping computational costs sub-linear, a key feature for handling multi-modal dynamics in complex environments [3][4].

- **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)**: In MBRL, an agent learns a model of the environment’s dynamics which is then used for planning optimal actions. Techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and trajectory optimization (e.g., Cross-Entropy Method) have been successfully applied to enhance sample efficiency compared to traditional model-free RL methods.

## 3. Proposed Approach: MoE-JEPA World Model for MBRL

### 3.1 Stage 1: Self-Supervised Pre-training of the Visual Encoder (JEPA-style)

- **Objective:** Learn robust visual representations from large-scale unlabeled video data.
- **Method:** Implement a Video-JEPA framework.
- **Architecture & Training:** 
  - **Encoder (E):** Maps video clips \( x \) to representations \( z = E(x) \).
  - **Predictor (P):** Given context \( x_{context} \), predict the target representation \( \hat{z}_{target} = P(E(x_{context})) \).
  - **Loss:** \( L_{JEPA} = \| \hat{z}_{target} - \text{stop\_gradient}(z_{target}) \|^2 \) (adapting principles from BYOL/DINO).
- **Output:** A robust, pre-trained visual encoder.

### 3.2 Stage 2: Training the Action-Conditioned MoE World Model

- **Objective:** Model the evolution of the abstract state representation \( z \) conditioned on actions \( a \) using an MoE architecture.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Input:** \( z_t = E(x_t) \) and action \( a_t \).
  - **Gating Network (G):** Determines expert routing based on \( z_t \) and \( a_t \).
  - **Expert Networks (Exp_i):** A set of \( N \) experts that predict potential next state representations.
  - **Output Combination:** Weighted combination of expert predictions to form the final prediction \( \hat{z}_{t+1} \).
  - **Reward Predictor (R):** Predicts immediate reward \( \hat{r}_t \).
- **Training Objective:**
  - **Dynamics Loss:** \( L_{dynamics} = \| \hat{z}_{t+1} - \text{stop\_gradient}(E(x_{t+1})) \|^2 \)
  - **Reward Loss:** \( L_{reward} = \| \hat{r}_t - r_t \|^2 \)
  - **Auxiliary MoE Loss:** \( L_{aux} \) (for load balancing among experts)
  - **Total Loss:** \( L_{WM} = L_{dynamics} + L_{reward} + \lambda \cdot L_{aux} \)
- **Output:** A trained MoE-JEPA world model consisting of (G, {Exp_i}, R) along with the frozen encoder \( E \).

### 3.3 Stage 3: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning and Planning

- **Objective:** Leverage the learned world model for planning and policy optimization.
- **Method:** Use model-based planning algorithms (e.g., MPC or CEM).
- **Process:**
  - **State Encoding:** Convert the current state \( x_t \) into \( z_t = E(x_t) \).
  - **Trajectory Simulation:** Use the world model to simulate future trajectories for candidate action sequences.
  - **Action Selection:** Choose the action sequence that maximizes the predicted cumulative reward.
  - **Execution & Update:** Execute the first action, observe the outcome, and update the replay buffer for iterative training.
- **Optional Policy Distillation:** Convert the planning process into a policy network using expert iteration (e.g., DAgger) or actor-critic methods.
