<ol start="2">
<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>
<p>The Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) represents a period of unparalleled cultural flourishing in Chinese history, witnessing remarkable advancements and artistic achievements across various domains, most notably in poetry and calligraphy.1 This era saw the establishment of government academies dedicated to the study of calligraphy, indicating a profound societal value and appreciation for this art form.2 Within this vibrant intellectual and artistic landscape emerged Zhang Xu (張旭), courtesy name Bogao (伯高), a native of Suzhou, who rose to prominence as an exceptional calligrapher renowned for his mastery of cursive script.3 His extraordinary skill earned him the esteemed title &ldquo;Sage of Cursive Script&rdquo; (草聖), a testament to his profound impact on the art.3 Zhang Xu is particularly celebrated for his unique and groundbreaking &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; (狂草) style, an innovative approach that set him apart from his contemporaries and exerted a significant influence on the development of calligraphy for centuries to come.1 His &ldquo;crazy cursive&rdquo; script, as it was also known, pushed the boundaries of traditional calligraphic expression, prioritizing dynamism and spontaneity.1 This report aims to provide a thorough analysis of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s life, his distinctive artistic style, and the scholarly reception of his work. It will also identify areas where current research is limited and suggest potential directions for future academic inquiry.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Objectives</li>
</ol>
<p>This research report pursues several key objectives to provide a comprehensive understanding of Zhang Xu and his calligraphic contributions. Firstly, it aims to synthesize the available biographical information on Zhang Xu, including his approximate lifespan, the official roles he held during the Tang Dynasty, and the significant life events that are believed to have influenced his artistic development.3 Secondly, the report seeks to meticulously analyze the distinctive features of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; calligraphy, identifying the core techniques he employed, the underlying artistic principles that guided his hand, and the overall aesthetic qualities that define his unique style.5 Thirdly, it endeavors to conduct a thorough review of existing academic literature, encompassing scholarly articles, books, and museum exhibition catalogs that have examined Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy and his profound impact on the art form during the Tang Dynasty.5 Fourthly, based on the gathered literature, the report intends to synthesize the findings, presenting a coherent summary of the current scholarly understanding of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s work, highlighting the major themes that have been explored, the various interpretations offered by scholars, and the critical evaluations that have been made.23 Fifthly, this research aims to critically evaluate the existing body of research to identify any limitations or underexplored facets of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy, his influence on subsequent calligraphers, or the broader historical and cultural context in which he worked.5 Sixthly, the report seeks to formulate a clear and focused problem statement that encapsulates the central research question or issue that this investigation aims to address regarding Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy. Finally, drawing upon the identified gaps in research, the report will propose potential avenues for future studies on Zhang Xu, suggesting specific research questions or areas of investigation that could further deepen our understanding of his artistic contributions and lasting legacy.9</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Problem Statement</li>
</ol>
<p>While Zhang Xu is widely acknowledged as a pivotal figure in the development of &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; calligraphy during the Tang Dynasty, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between his unconventional artistic practice, the specific social and cultural conditions of his time, and the subsequent reception and interpretation of his work by later generations remains an area requiring further scholarly attention. This research endeavors to address this gap in current knowledge by synthesizing the existing body of scholarship, identifying aspects of his calligraphy and its context that have not been fully explored, and proposing specific directions for future academic inquiry that could lead to a more nuanced and complete appreciation of his artistic achievements.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Literature Review</li>
</ol>
<p>The scholarly understanding of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s life and calligraphy is built upon a foundation of historical accounts, anecdotes, and art historical analyses. Early biographical information often relies on fragmented records and legendary tales, such as his inclusion among Du Fu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eight Drunken Immortals&rdquo;.3 These accounts frequently highlight his eccentric behavior, including the well-known anecdote of him using his hair as a brush to create calligraphy while intoxicated.3 The consistency of these stories across various historical sources, despite their potentially embellished nature, suggests a deliberate construction of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s artistic persona, possibly reflecting a broader Tang Dynasty appreciation for individuality and artistic eccentricity. This might be connected to Daoist or Chan Buddhist ideals that valued spontaneity and transcending conventional norms.5 However, it is crucial to approach these anecdotal accounts with a critical eye, acknowledging the potential for hagiography and the need to distinguish between legend and verifiable historical fact.</p>
<p>Scholarly analyses of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphic style often focus on the characteristics of his &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; (狂草). These studies frequently emphasize its dynamism, unpredictability, and the powerful sense of momentum conveyed through his brushstrokes.6 For instance, the modern scholar Han Yutao described his work as &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; &ldquo;strange and always varied,&rdquo; and &ldquo;formidable&rdquo;.6 This recurring emphasis on &ldquo;wildness&rdquo; and the unexpected nature of his characters suggests a deliberate artistic choice to move beyond the formal constraints of earlier styles in favor of a more spontaneous and expressive approach. Interpretations of his work often link his unique style to his personality and emotional states.1 The idea that Zhang Xu &ldquo;unleashed his feelings through cursive script,&rdquo; as noted by Han Yu 10, aligns with traditional Chinese art theory, which often views artistic expression as deeply intertwined with the artist&rsquo;s character and inner cultivation.</p>
<p>Comparisons between Zhang Xu and other prominent cursive script masters, such as Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, and Huaisu, are also prevalent in the literature.3 While Zhang Xu inherited from the calligraphic tradition of the &ldquo;Er Wangs&rdquo; (Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi), his &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; is often positioned as a radical departure from their more restrained elegance, representing a significant development in the expressiveness of this script style.3 He is frequently paired with the younger Huaisu as the two greatest cursive calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty, often affectionately referred to as &ldquo;Crazy Zhang and Drunk Su&rdquo; (顛張醉素).3 Despite his fame for cursive script, scholarly discussions also acknowledge Zhang Xu&rsquo;s proficiency in regular script (楷書).3 His regular script is described as dignified and vigorous, demonstrating a strong foundation in traditional calligraphic principles, suggesting that his &ldquo;craziness&rdquo; in cursive was a deliberate artistic choice rather than a lack of formal skill.6</p>
<p>The influence of Zhang Xu on later calligraphers is another significant theme in the literature. Yan Zhenqing (709 – 785 AD), a renowned calligrapher in his own right, is said to have sought instruction from Zhang Xu on multiple occasions, even resigning from official duties to dedicate himself to studying his brushwork.1 This highlights the profound impact Zhang Xu had on his contemporaries and the subsequent development of calligraphic styles. His &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; served as an inspiration for later calligraphers who aimed for greater expressive freedom in their work, contributing to the evolution of cursive script as an art form capable of conveying intense emotions and personal style.9 References to Zhang Xu&rsquo;s work can also be found in numerous exhibition catalogs and museum collection databases 19, underscoring his enduring canonical status in the history of Chinese calligraphy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, scholarly interpretations have explored the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy, connecting it to broader concepts such as Daoism, Chan Buddhism, and the expression of the individual spirit.5 Some scholars believe his spontaneous and uninhibited style was influenced by the Daoist practice of automatic writing in sand.5 The link between his &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; and the principles of Taoism and Zen Buddhism further suggests a spiritual dimension to his artistic practice, where the focus on intuition and the transcendence of formal rules played a significant role.28</p>

<li>Biography of Zhang Xu (張旭)</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Xu was born in Wu County (present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu Province) around 675 AD.3 His family had notable connections to the world of calligraphy; his maternal great-grandfather was the celebrated calligrapher Yu Shinan (558 – 638 AD), and his maternal great-uncle was Lu Jianzhi (585 – 638 AD).7 This familial background suggests an early exposure to calligraphic traditions and likely fostered his interest and development in the art. While details of his early life remain scarce, historical records indicate that Zhang Xu served as a government official, holding relatively low-ranking positions. He held the post of wei (尉), a rank comparable to a county magistrate, in Changshu County.6 Additionally, his official career took him to the imperial capital Chang&rsquo;an and to Shangjing (located in present-day Heilongjiang Province).7 He also held the official title of Zhang Changshi (張長史), which signifies a role as a regional officer or within the imperial administration.3 Although he did not reach the highest levels of political power, his service as an official provided him with opportunities to engage with the cultural and intellectual elite of the Tang Dynasty, fostering connections with other prominent literati.7</p>
<p>Zhang Xu lived during the High Tang period (712-755 AD), a time widely regarded as the golden age of Chinese culture.7 This era of prosperity and artistic innovation provided a fertile ground for the development of his unique calligraphic style. Several anecdotes offer insights into the influences that shaped his art. One notable story recounts how he grasped the essence of cursive writing by observing the dynamic movements of porters fighting and the captivating solo performance of the sword-dancer Lady Gongsun (公孫大娘).3 These observations of energy and flow in the real world are believed to have profoundly influenced his approach to calligraphic strokes, allowing him to translate movement and dynamism onto paper. Perhaps the most famous legend associated with Zhang Xu is that of him using his hair as a brush while intoxicated.3 This eccentric practice earned him the enduring nickname &ldquo;Crazy Zhang&rdquo; (張顛) and has become a quintessential part of his artistic persona, symbolizing his uninhibited and unconventional approach to calligraphy.</p>
<p>Zhang Xu was also a prominent member of the &ldquo;Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup&rdquo; (飲中八仙), a celebrated group of Tang Dynasty scholars known for their love of wine, as immortalized in the poetry of Du Fu.3 His inclusion in this esteemed circle, along with his friendships with other influential figures such as the renowned poets Li Bai and the calligrapher Yan Zhenqing 1, underscores his integration into the vibrant artistic and intellectual community of the Tang Dynasty, where wine was often associated with creative inspiration and unbridled expression.</p>

<li>The Unique Characteristics of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s Calligraphy</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy is most notably defined by his innovative and highly expressive &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; (狂草) style. This unique approach to writing is characterized by several key features. Firstly, his calligraphy exhibits a remarkable dynamism and momentum, often appearing to be completed in a single, continuous sweep of the brush, conveying a powerful sense of energy and movement to the viewer.6 Secondly, his brushstrokes and the structure of his characters are frequently unpredictable and varied, deviating from conventional forms and showcasing a remarkable degree of spontaneity.6 Han Yutao&rsquo;s description of his work as &ldquo;strange and always varied&rdquo; aptly captures this quality.6 Thirdly, Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy possesses a sense of formidability and power, a departure from the more delicate and slender beauty often found in earlier calligraphic works.6 The metaphors used to describe his style, such as feeling &ldquo;pressed down by stones&rdquo; or &ldquo;threatened by a sword,&rdquo; underscore this powerful impact.6 Fourthly, his &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; is exceptionally expressive, serving as a conduit for his emotions and inner state.1 The belief that he &ldquo;unleashed his feelings through cursive script&rdquo; 10 highlights the deeply personal and emotional nature of his art. Finally, his work often demonstrates a strong sense of interconnectedness, with strokes and sometimes entire characters flowing seamlessly together, creating a unified and rhythmic visual experience.9</p>
<p>Zhang Xu employed several distinctive techniques to achieve these characteristics. His brush movements were typically rapid and fluid, contributing to the sense of momentum. He also utilized variations in ink density and pressure to create dynamic lines with varying textures and visual weight.9 The abbreviation and merging of strokes, common in cursive script, were taken to an extreme in his &ldquo;wild cursive,&rdquo; further enhancing the speed and flow of his writing.9 Throughout his work, there is a clear emphasis on the overall composition and the energetic flow (行氣) that binds the individual elements together.34</p>
<p>Underlying these techniques were several key artistic principles. Spontaneity and naturalness appear to have been paramount, potentially influenced by Daoist philosophy, which valued living in harmony with the natural world and allowing for unforced expression.5 The expression of individual spirit and emotions was also a central tenet, aligning with the broader literati tradition of art as a reflection of the artist&rsquo;s inner self.5 Furthermore, Zhang Xu&rsquo;s &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; embodies a clear breaking away from traditional norms and conventions, representing a significant moment of stylistic innovation in the history of Chinese calligraphy.3</p>
<p>While Zhang Xu is primarily known for his &ldquo;wild cursive,&rdquo; he was also highly proficient in the more disciplined regular script (楷書).3 His regular script is described as dignified and vigorous, exhibiting a refined subtlety.6 It showed a clear influence from earlier Tang masters of regular script, namely Ouyang Xun and Yu Shinan.1 His mastery of this foundational style underscores the idea that his radical innovations in cursive script were not due to a lack of formal training but rather a deliberate artistic choice to explore the expressive potential beyond traditional constraints.</p>
<p>Comparing Zhang Xu with other calligraphers of his era highlights the unique nature of his contribution. His expressive &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; stands in contrast to the more formal and elegant styles of earlier Tang masters such as Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang, and Xue Ji.1 While he inherited from the tradition of Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi, his &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; represents a significant evolution, pushing the boundaries of expressiveness beyond their refined elegance.3 His close association with Huaisu, who also practiced &ldquo;wild cursive,&rdquo; suggests a shared artistic spirit during the Tang Dynasty, where a move towards greater individual expression and stylistic innovation was taking place.3 The pairing of these two figures as the greatest cursive calligraphers of their time signifies a notable shift in calligraphic aesthetics.</p>

<li>Gaps in Recent Research</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the recognition of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s significance in the history of Chinese calligraphy, several gaps remain in recent research. While certain masterpieces like Gushi Sitie and Shiwuri Tie are frequently mentioned 6, a comprehensive art historical analysis of all reliably attributed extant works by Zhang Xu, including detailed information on their provenance, condition, and stylistic evolution over time, appears to be lacking, particularly in English-language scholarship.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the socio-cultural context that fostered the appreciation for the &ldquo;wildness&rdquo; of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s style warrants further exploration. The Tang Dynasty&rsquo;s reputation for being a relatively open and cosmopolitan era 12 likely played a role in the acceptance of such unconventional artistic expression. However, the specific ways in which this cultural environment enabled and valued his radical approach to calligraphy could be investigated in more detail.</p>
<p>While there is mention of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s influence on Japanese calligraphers 12, a more in-depth study focusing on the specific ways his style was received, interpreted, and adapted within Japanese calligraphic traditions would be a valuable contribution to the field.</p>
<p>The potential relationship between Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy and the dynamic, expressive nature of Tang poetry, beyond the well-known anecdote involving Du Fu, also presents an opportunity for further research. Investigating whether the aesthetic principles and rhythmic qualities of Tang poetry influenced his calligraphic style could yield new insights into his artistic sensibilities.</p>
<p>A focused study on the materials and techniques employed by Zhang Xu, examining the types of paper, ink, and brushes available during his time and how these might have influenced the characteristics of his &ldquo;wild cursive,&rdquo; could also provide valuable information about his artistic practice.</p>
<p>Finally, the reception history of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy beyond the perspectives of fellow calligraphers and connoisseurs remains largely unexplored. Understanding how his work was perceived by a broader audience during his lifetime and in subsequent centuries, including any potential variations in interpretation or critical evaluations of his &ldquo;wildness,&rdquo; could offer a more comprehensive understanding of his legacy.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Future Studies</li>
</ol>
<p>Building upon the identified gaps in current research, several avenues for future studies on Zhang Xu and his calligraphy can be proposed. A fundamental contribution would be the development of a comprehensive catalogue raisonné of all attributed and reliably sourced works by Zhang Xu. This resource, incorporating high-resolution images and detailed art historical analysis, would serve as an essential tool for future scholarship.</p>
<p>Further research could delve into the aesthetics of &ldquo;wildness&rdquo; in Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy, exploring the underlying artistic principles in relation to Tang Dynasty art theory concepts such as spontaneity, energy (氣), and the expression of the self. This might involve a close analysis of contemporary and later writings on aesthetics and calligraphy.</p>
<p>Investigating the broader context of Tang Dynasty visual culture, including painting and dance, to identify potential cross-influences on Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphic style could also yield valuable insights. Comparative studies examining the visual rhythms and expressive qualities across these different art forms might reveal previously unnoticed connections.</p>
<p>A focused study on the reception and interpretation of Zhang Xu&rsquo;s calligraphy in Japan would be another fruitful area of investigation. Analyzing specific examples of Japanese calligraphy that show his influence and exploring their cultural significance could enhance our understanding of his international impact.</p>
<p>Employing interdisciplinary approaches could also offer new perspectives. Incorporating literary theory to analyze the &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; or &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; qualities of his cursive script, or utilizing cognitive science to understand the viewer&rsquo;s experience of his dynamic compositions, could provide fresh insights into the impact and meaning of his work.</p>
<p>The application of digital humanities methodologies, such as using digital tools for analyzing brushstrokes, spatial relationships, and overall structure, could uncover patterns and provide new insights into Zhang Xu&rsquo;s techniques that have been difficult to discern through traditional methods.</p>
<p>A comparative study of artistic eccentricity in the Tang Dynasty, examining Zhang Xu alongside other artists and poets known for their unconventional behavior, could shed light on the cultural significance and function of such behavior within the artistic sphere of that period.</p>
<p>Finally, further translation and in-depth analysis of primary Tang Dynasty texts that discuss or mention Zhang Xu and his calligraphy would be invaluable for gaining a deeper understanding of contemporary perceptions and interpretations of his work.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Zhang Xu stands as a pivotal and transformative figure in the history of Chinese calligraphy, primarily recognized for his groundbreaking and highly expressive &ldquo;wild cursive&rdquo; style. His work pushed the boundaries of traditional calligraphic expression, prioritizing dynamism, spontaneity, and the direct conveyance of personal emotion. Biographical details, though often intertwined with legend, paint a picture of an eccentric yet highly skilled artist deeply embedded in the vibrant cultural landscape of the High Tang Dynasty. The unique characteristics of his calligraphy, marked by its energy, unpredictability, power, and interconnectedness, set him apart from his predecessors and contemporaries. While his mastery of regular script demonstrates a strong foundation in traditional techniques, it was his innovative approach to cursive script that secured his enduring legacy. Despite existing scholarship, gaps remain in our comprehensive understanding of his extant works, the socio-cultural context of his &ldquo;wildness,&rdquo; his influence beyond China, and the broader reception of his art. Future studies employing a range of methodologies, from detailed art historical analysis to interdisciplinary approaches, hold the promise of further enriching our appreciation of this remarkable artist and his significant contributions to Tang Dynasty culture.</p>
