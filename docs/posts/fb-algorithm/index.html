<meta name="description" content="## Facebook Algorithm Insights for 2025 This document summarizes key insights into the Facebook algorithm for 2025, drawing from the provided sources. ### What is the Facebook Algorithm? * The Facebook algorithm uses programming rules and **machine learning to decide what you see in your Facebook Feed**. * It selects posts, Stories, and ads based on your **interactions, the type of content, and how recent the posts are**, aiming to give you a personalized and engaging experience. * The algorithm has transformed into a **sophisticated, AI-driven system focused on delivering content that resonates with users’ preferences**. * Meta acknowledges the algorithm’s imperfections and the possibility that it may never achieve flawlessness, but there’s a clear commitment to evolving and refining its approach to align with user desires. * **Facebook&#39;s algorithm determines what content users see and can greatly affect your posts’ interaction and engagement numbers**. * Understanding these algorithms is crucial for individuals and businesses alike, as it can greatly impact their online presence and success. ### How the Facebook News Feed Algorithm Works in 2025 * The Facebook algorithm now actively recommends a significant amount of content from sources users haven&#39;t connected with, accounting for **over 20% of content in the Feed**. This marks a transformation into a powerful content discovery engine. * The algorithm increasingly emphasizes &#34;**meaningful interactions**&#34; – actions like thoughtful comments and discussion-provoking shares – rather than just simple likes. * Meta has publicly described the basic process the algorithm uses to rank connected content (from user connections) through four main steps: **Inventory, Signals, Predictions, Score**. This process is widely confirmed across various documents and analyses. * **Inventory:** The system gathers all potential posts that could be displayed in a user&#39;s Feed since their last login. For connected content, sources include posts from friends, Pages the user follows, and Groups they have joined. Content violating Facebook&#39;s Community Standards is removed at this stage. * **Signals:** The algorithm considers thousands of &#34;**signals**&#34; – various data points – to assess the relevance and value of each post to the specific user. These signals include information about the poster (relationship to the user, interaction history), characteristics of the post (content type, time posted), and how the user has interacted with similar content in the past. * **Predictions:** AI powers complex **prediction models (Meta mentions over 100 models for Feed alone)** to calculate relevance scores for each post based on thousands of signals. These models include deep neural networks, attention models, and graph neural networks to capture complex data relationships. Meta uses advanced research models like MViT (for video), XLM-R/XLM-V (for language), FLAVA/Omnivore (multimodal) to understand content across different formats. * **Score:** Based on the predictions, each post receives a relevance score, and the Feed is ranked accordingly. * Ranking **recommended content** (from unfollowed sources) requires more complex AI systems capable of analyzing vast amounts of content outside the user&#39;s network. These systems predict interests based on overall platform behavior, content semantics, and broader user behavior patterns. * The internal technical reality is a **multi-stage ranking architecture**: * **Candidate Selection:** Gathering potential posts. * **Lightweight Filtering:** Quickly narrowing the pool using initial machine learning models. * **Heavy Scoring (Neural Network Pass):** Deploying more powerful neural network models for detailed prediction scores. * The scale of operation (billions of users, trillions of posts, thousands of signals) necessitates such efficiency. ### How Facebook Recommends Content * Facebook’s system for recommending content presents a valuable opportunity for brands and creators to engage new audiences without relying on paid advertising. * No two users will see the same set of recommendations, aligning with Facebook’s objective to provide relevant and valuable recommendations tailored to each individual. * To enhance your content’s likelihood of being recommended, it’s crucial to understand and comply with Facebook’s guidelines and Community Standards. * Facebook actively demotes or removes content considered problematic, including misinformation, fake news, spam, engagement bait, clickbait, low-quality content, sensational health claims, hate speech, etc.. ### Content to Avoid * **Content compromising safety**, like discussions of self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, sexually explicit material, or promotion of regulated products. * **Sensitive or low-quality content**, such as ‘miracle’ health supplements or questionable financial schemes. * **Disliked content by users**, like clickbait or engagement bait. * **Low-quality publishing**, such as news content lacking transparent authorship. * **False or misleading content**, including fake news or claims debunked by independent fact-checkers, like vaccine misinformation. * **Clickbait**, which typically consists of exaggerated, almost spam-like content that makes over-the-top promises but fails to fulfill them. * **Engagement bait**, which involves using captions or images that explicitly prompt user actions without genuinely enhancing user interaction or providing value. Examples include &#34;Like this post if you are an early bird, share it if you’re a night owl&#34;. * **Reposting content from other sources without adding value** will have limited reach. * Blurry, low-resolution **videos**, those with watermarks from other apps (like TikTok), videos with borders, or horizontal format videos for Reels. ### Tips for Working with Facebook’s Algorithm * **Create Relevant Content for Your Target Audience**: Your primary objective should always be to produce high-quality content that truly resonates with your audience. The more relevant and effective your content is, the more likely it is to garner engagement. Use metrics in Facebook Insights to analyze what performs well. * **Don’t Use Clickbait and Engagement Bait**: Facebook frequently updates its algorithm to identify and reduce the reach of such posts. * **Engage Facebook Users and Encourage Interaction**: Interaction plays a significant role in how the Facebook algorithm ranks content. Design your posts to maximize engagement and spark dialogue. Respond to your audience when possible. * **Avoid Spreading Fake News**: Distributing fake news is a violation of Facebook’s Community Standards and can lead to severe consequences, including being banned. * **Post Consistently, but Focus on Quality Over Quantity**. * **Utilize Facebook’s Features** like Stories, Live videos, or Groups to increase engagement. * **Engage with Other Posts and Respond Promptly to Comments**. Facebook suggests replying within 24 hours. * **Understand Your Audience’s Preferences and Behaviors**, using analytics to align your social media strategy. * **Transform Your Best Reviews into Concise Facebook Posts** and tag the individuals who left them to enhance engagement and bring in new followers. * **Create Engaging Video Content**: Facebook offers various video formats, including Reels and Stories (shorter clips), as well as Facebook Videos on Demand and Live videos. Reels has emerged as Facebook’s most rapidly growing content format. Focus on crafting original and authentic videos that embody your brand’s unique voice. Optimize creative elements for mobile users, including vertical format, shorter and impactful text, clear overlays, and concise headlines. **Prioritize short-form videos (Reels) over static posts**. * **Don’t Forget the Basic Status Post**: Simple status posts (without photos, videos, or links) can be excellent for conveying straightforward information and securing high engagement levels. * **Put Ad Dollars Behind Your Most Impactful Content**: Boost or sponsor posts that already perform well organically. Ensure your content is engaging and relevant to your audience. * **Create content that encourages people to share via Messenger** (memes, insightful posts, relatable content). Prompt your audience to send posts to friends or discuss in group chats. **Private sharing (Messenger, WhatsApp, DMs) is now tracked as a ranking factor**. * **Posts that feel thoughtful, genuine, and relevant** are far more likely to get people to pause, react, or share. * Ask yourself, &#34;**Would people share my story with their friends or recommend it to others?**&#34; before publishing. * **Share posts that work on Facebook**: According to a 2024 Meta report, nearly 98% of viewed posts didn’t include a link. Most of what appears in feeds is content viewable without leaving the platform (reels, photos, carousels, text-based posts). Use links selectively and avoid linking to &#34;low-quality web experiences&#34;. * **Publish posts that create meaningful conversations**: Facebook likes authentic accounts that contribute to their community and help start or sustain thoughtful conversations. * The algorithm increasingly shows preference for content that is **authentic and showcases the human side of a brand**. Effective strategies include featuring employees or customers, using real photos, sharing behind-the-scenes content, telling personal stories, and interacting sincerely. * **A notable trend is the algorithm&#39;s increasing prioritization of content shared within Facebook Groups**. Posts within highly engaged Groups now have the potential for better visibility. Active participation in or building relevant Facebook Groups is becoming increasingly important. ### Facebook Not Paying Creators in 2025 * As of **August 31, 2025, Facebook will no longer offer monetization programs for Reels**, meaning the end of earning from Ads on Reels, In-stream Ads, and Bonus Programs. * Some creators have been experiencing issues with not getting paid by Facebook, even before the announced end of Reels monetization. This includes withheld payments and lack of clear reasons or support. * Despite the discontinuation of some programs, some users are still exploring and discussing ways to monetize their Facebook content in 2025. * There are reports of issues with existing monetization features like In-stream Ads. * Some creators suggest shifting focus from relying on platform monetization to building their own online businesses and promoting digital products. * There are discussions and tutorials about Facebook monetization still existing in 2025. * Facebook has announced a new bonus program for story views. ### Facebook Algorithm Changes and Meta&#39;s Approach * In 2025, Facebook&#39;s algorithm updates focus on **AI-driven recommendations, deeper engagement metrics, and a shift toward meaningful interactions**. * Meta is aiming to have the world’s best recommendation technology by the end of 2026. * Meta is moving away from its third-party fact-checking program in the US and moving to a **Community Notes model**, similar to X, where the community decides when posts are potentially misleading and need more context. * Meta will allow **more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics** that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations. * They will take a **more personalized approach to political content**, so that people who want to see more of it in their feeds can. * Meta acknowledges over-enforcing rules and wants to undo the mission creep that has made rules too restrictive. They will rely more on user reports for less severe policy violations and require a much higher degree of confidence before content is taken down. ### Tools for Managing Facebook Content * **SocialBee** offers features for content creation, engagement, scheduling &amp; publishing, collaboration, AI assistance, and analytics to help manage social media content. It can help with creating, publishing, analyzing, engaging, and collaborating on Facebook. SocialBee has an Engagement Module and a Social Inbox. This summary provides an overview of the Facebook algorithm in 2025 based on the provided sources. Remember that algorithms are constantly evolving, so staying updated with the latest insights is crucial. " />

This process is widely confirmed across various documents and analyses. * **Inventory:** The system gathers all potential posts that could be displayed in a user&#39;s Feed since their last login. For connected content, sources include posts from friends, Pages the user follows, and Groups they have joined. Content violating Facebook&#39;s Community Standards is removed at this stage. * **Signals:** The algorithm considers thousands of &#34;**signals**&#34; – various data points – to assess the relevance and value of each post to the specific user. These signals include information about the poster (relationship to the user, interaction history), characteristics of the post (content type, time posted), and how the user has interacted with similar content in the past. * **Predictions:** AI powers complex **prediction models (Meta mentions over 100 models for Feed alone)** to calculate relevance scores for each post based on thousands of signals. These models include deep neural networks, attention models, and graph neural networks to capture complex data relationships. Meta uses advanced research models like MViT (for video), XLM-R/XLM-V (for language), FLAVA/Omnivore (multimodal) to understand content across different formats. * **Score:** Based on the predictions, each post receives a relevance score, and the Feed is ranked accordingly. * Ranking **recommended content** (from unfollowed sources) requires more complex AI systems capable of analyzing vast amounts of content outside the user&#39;s network. These systems predict interests based on overall platform behavior, content semantics, and broader user behavior patterns. * The internal technical reality is a **multi-stage ranking architecture**: * **Candidate Selection:** Gathering potential posts. * **Lightweight Filtering:** Quickly narrowing the pool using initial machine learning models. * **Heavy Scoring (Neural Network Pass):** Deploying more powerful neural network models for detailed prediction scores. * The scale of operation (billions of users, trillions of posts, thousands of signals) necessitates such efficiency. ### How Facebook Recommends Content * Facebook’s system for recommending content presents a valuable opportunity for brands and creators to engage new audiences without relying on paid advertising. * No two users will see the same set of recommendations, aligning with Facebook’s objective to provide relevant and valuable recommendations tailored to each individual. * To enhance your content’s likelihood of being recommended, it’s crucial to understand and comply with Facebook’s guidelines and Community Standards. * Facebook actively demotes or removes content considered problematic, including misinformation, fake news, spam, engagement bait, clickbait, low-quality content, sensational health claims, hate speech, etc.. ### Content to Avoid * **Content compromising safety**, like discussions of self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, sexually explicit material, or promotion of regulated products. * **Sensitive or low-quality content**, such as ‘miracle’ health supplements or questionable financial schemes. * **Disliked content by users**, like clickbait or engagement bait. * **Low-quality publishing**, such as news content lacking transparent authorship. * **False or misleading content**, including fake news or claims debunked by independent fact-checkers, like vaccine misinformation. * **Clickbait**, which typically consists of exaggerated, almost spam-like content that makes over-the-top promises but fails to fulfill them. * **Engagement bait**, which involves using captions or images that explicitly prompt user actions without genuinely enhancing user interaction or providing value. Examples include &#34;Like this post if you are an early bird, share it if you’re a night owl&#34;. * **Reposting content from other sources without adding value** will have limited reach. * Blurry, low-resolution **videos**, those with watermarks from other apps (like TikTok), videos with borders, or horizontal format videos for Reels. ### Tips for Working with Facebook’s Algorithm * **Create Relevant Content for Your Target Audience**: Your primary objective should always be to produce high-quality content that truly resonates with your audience. The more relevant and effective your content is, the more likely it is to garner engagement. Use metrics in Facebook Insights to analyze what performs well. * **Don’t Use Clickbait and Engagement Bait**: Facebook frequently updates its algorithm to identify and reduce the reach of such posts. * **Engage Facebook Users and Encourage Interaction**: Interaction plays a significant role in how the Facebook algorithm ranks content. Design your posts to maximize engagement and spark dialogue. Respond to your audience when possible. * **Avoid Spreading Fake News**: Distributing fake news is a violation of Facebook’s Community Standards and can lead to severe consequences, including being banned. * **Post Consistently, but Focus on Quality Over Quantity**. * **Utilize Facebook’s Features** like Stories, Live videos, or Groups to increase engagement. * **Engage with Other Posts and Respond Promptly to Comments**. Facebook suggests replying within 24 hours. * **Understand Your Audience’s Preferences and Behaviors**, using analytics to align your social media strategy. * **Transform Your Best Reviews into Concise Facebook Posts** and tag the individuals who left them to enhance engagement and bring in new followers. * **Create Engaging Video Content**: Facebook offers various video formats, including Reels and Stories (shorter clips), as well as Facebook Videos on Demand and Live videos. Reels has emerged as Facebook’s most rapidly growing content format. Focus on crafting original and authentic videos that embody your brand’s unique voice. Optimize creative elements for mobile users, including vertical format, shorter and impactful text, clear overlays, and concise headlines. **Prioritize short-form videos (Reels) over static posts**. * **Don’t Forget the Basic Status Post**: Simple status posts (without photos, videos, or links) can be excellent for conveying straightforward information and securing high engagement levels. * **Put Ad Dollars Behind Your Most Impactful Content**: Boost or sponsor posts that already perform well organically. Ensure your content is engaging and relevant to your audience. * **Create content that encourages people to share via Messenger** (memes, insightful posts, relatable content). Prompt your audience to send posts to friends or discuss in group chats. **Private sharing (Messenger, WhatsApp, DMs) is now tracked as a ranking factor**. * **Posts that feel thoughtful, genuine, and relevant** are far more likely to get people to pause, react, or share. * Ask yourself, &#34;**Would people share my story with their friends or recommend it to others?**&#34; before publishing. * **Share posts that work on Facebook**: According to a 2024 Meta report, nearly 98% of viewed posts didn’t include a link. Most of what appears in feeds is content viewable without leaving the platform (reels, photos, carousels, text-based posts). Use links selectively and avoid linking to &#34;low-quality web experiences&#34;. * **Publish posts that create meaningful conversations**: Facebook likes authentic accounts that contribute to their community and help start or sustain thoughtful conversations. * The algorithm increasingly shows preference for content that is **authentic and showcases the human side of a brand**. Effective strategies include featuring employees or customers, using real photos, sharing behind-the-scenes content, telling personal stories, and interacting sincerely. * **A notable trend is the algorithm&#39;s increasing prioritization of content shared within Facebook Groups**. Posts within highly engaged Groups now have the potential for better visibility. Active participation in or building relevant Facebook Groups is becoming increasingly important. ### Facebook Not Paying Creators in 2025 * As of **August 31, 2025, Facebook will no longer offer monetization programs for Reels**, meaning the end of earning from Ads on Reels, In-stream Ads, and Bonus Programs. * Some creators have been experiencing issues with not getting paid by Facebook, even before the announced end of Reels monetization. This includes withheld payments and lack of clear reasons or support. * Despite the discontinuation of some programs, some users are still exploring and discussing ways to monetize their Facebook content in 2025. * There are reports of issues with existing monetization features like In-stream Ads. * Some creators suggest shifting focus from relying on platform monetization to building their own online businesses and promoting digital products. * There are discussions and tutorials about Facebook monetization still existing in 2025. * Facebook has announced a new bonus program for story views. ### Facebook Algorithm Changes and Meta&#39;s Approach * In 2025, Facebook&#39;s algorithm updates focus on **AI-driven recommendations, deeper engagement metrics, and a shift toward meaningful interactions**. * Meta is aiming to have the world’s best recommendation technology by the end of 2026. * Meta is moving away from its third-party fact-checking program in the US and moving to a **Community Notes model**, similar to X, where the community decides when posts are potentially misleading and need more context. * Meta will allow **more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics** that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations. * They will take a **more personalized approach to political content**, so that people who want to see more of it in their feeds can. * Meta acknowledges over-enforcing rules and wants to undo the mission creep that has made rules too restrictive. They will rely more on user reports for less severe policy violations and require a much higher degree of confidence before content is taken down. ### Tools for Managing Facebook Content * **SocialBee** offers features for content creation, engagement, scheduling &amp; publishing, collaboration, AI assistance, and analytics to help manage social media content. It can help with creating, publishing, analyzing, engaging, and collaborating on Facebook. SocialBee has an Engagement Module and a Social Inbox. This summary provides an overview of the Facebook algorithm in 2025 based on the provided sources. Remember that algorithms are constantly evolving, so staying updated with the latest insights is crucial. ">

This document summarizes key insights into the Facebook algorithm for 2025, drawing from the provided sources.

### What is the Facebook Algorithm?

*   The Facebook algorithm uses programming rules and **machine learning to decide what you see in your Facebook Feed**.
*   It selects posts, Stories, and ads based on your **interactions, the type of content, and how recent the posts are**, aiming to give you a personalized and engaging experience.
*   The algorithm has transformed into a **sophisticated, AI-driven system focused on delivering content that resonates with users’ preferences**.
*   Meta acknowledges the algorithm’s imperfections and the possibility that it may never achieve flawlessness, but there’s a clear commitment to evolving and refining its approach to align with user desires.
*   **Facebook&#39;s algorithm determines what content users see and can greatly affect your posts’ interaction and engagement numbers**.
*   Understanding these algorithms is crucial for individuals and businesses alike, as it can greatly impact their online presence and success.

### How the Facebook News Feed Algorithm Works in 2025

*   The Facebook algorithm now actively recommends a significant amount of content from sources users haven&#39;t connected with, accounting for **over 20% of content in the Feed**. This marks a transformation into a powerful content discovery engine.
*   The algorithm increasingly emphasizes &#34;**meaningful interactions**&#34; – actions like thoughtful comments and discussion-provoking shares – rather than just simple likes.
*   Meta has publicly described the basic process the algorithm uses to rank connected content (from user connections) through four main steps: **Inventory, Signals, Predictions, Score**. This process is widely confirmed across various documents and analyses.
    *   **Inventory:** The system gathers all potential posts that could be displayed in a user&#39;s Feed since their last login. For connected content, sources include posts from friends, Pages the user follows, and Groups they have joined. Content violating Facebook&#39;s Community Standards is removed at this stage.
    *   **Signals:** The algorithm considers thousands of &#34;**signals**&#34; – various data points – to assess the relevance and value of each post to the specific user. These signals include information about the poster (relationship to the user, interaction history), characteristics of the post (content type, time posted), and how the user has interacted with similar content in the past.
    *   **Predictions:** AI powers complex **prediction models (Meta mentions over 100 models for Feed alone)** to calculate relevance scores for each post based on thousands of signals. These models include deep neural networks, attention models, and graph neural networks to capture complex data relationships. Meta uses advanced research models like MViT (for video), XLM-R/XLM-V (for language), FLAVA/Omnivore (multimodal) to understand content across different formats.
    *   **Score:** Based on the predictions, each post receives a relevance score, and the Feed is ranked accordingly.
*   Ranking **recommended content** (from unfollowed sources) requires more complex AI systems capable of analyzing vast amounts of content outside the user&#39;s network. These systems predict interests based on overall platform behavior, content semantics, and broader user behavior patterns.
*   The internal technical reality is a **multi-stage ranking architecture**:
    *   **Candidate Selection:** Gathering potential posts.
    *   **Lightweight Filtering:** Quickly narrowing the pool using initial machine learning models.
    *   **Heavy Scoring (Neural Network Pass):** Deploying more powerful neural network models for detailed prediction scores.
*   The scale of operation (billions of users, trillions of posts, thousands of signals) necessitates such efficiency.

### How Facebook Recommends Content

*   Facebook’s system for recommending content presents a valuable opportunity for brands and creators to engage new audiences without relying on paid advertising.
*   No two users will see the same set of recommendations, aligning with Facebook’s objective to provide relevant and valuable recommendations tailored to each individual.
*   To enhance your content’s likelihood of being recommended, it’s crucial to understand and comply with Facebook’s guidelines and Community Standards.
*   Facebook actively demotes or removes content considered problematic, including misinformation, fake news, spam, engagement bait, clickbait, low-quality content, sensational health claims, hate speech, etc..

### Content to Avoid

*   **Content compromising safety**, like discussions of self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, sexually explicit material, or promotion of regulated products.
*   **Sensitive or low-quality content**, such as ‘miracle’ health supplements or questionable financial schemes.
*   **Disliked content by users**, like clickbait or engagement bait.
*   **Low-quality publishing**, such as news content lacking transparent authorship.
*   **False or misleading content**, including fake news or claims debunked by independent fact-checkers, like vaccine misinformation.
*   **Clickbait**, which typically consists of exaggerated, almost spam-like content that makes over-the-top promises but fails to fulfill them.
*   **Engagement bait**, which involves using captions or images that explicitly prompt user actions without genuinely enhancing user interaction or providing value. Examples include &#34;Like this post if you are an early bird, share it if you’re a night owl&#34;.
*   **Reposting content from other sources without adding value** will have limited reach.
*   Blurry, low-resolution **videos**, those with watermarks from other apps (like TikTok), videos with borders, or horizontal format videos for Reels.

### Tips for Working with Facebook’s Algorithm

*   **Create Relevant Content for Your Target Audience**: Your primary objective should always be to produce high-quality content that truly resonates with your audience. The more relevant and effective your content is, the more likely it is to garner engagement. Use metrics in Facebook Insights to analyze what performs well.
*   **Don’t Use Clickbait and Engagement Bait**: Facebook frequently updates its algorithm to identify and reduce the reach of such posts.
*   **Engage Facebook Users and Encourage Interaction**: Interaction plays a significant role in how the Facebook algorithm ranks content. Design your posts to maximize engagement and spark dialogue. Respond to your audience when possible.
*   **Avoid Spreading Fake News**: Distributing fake news is a violation of Facebook’s Community Standards and can lead to severe consequences, including being banned.
*   **Post Consistently, but Focus on Quality Over Quantity**.
*   **Utilize Facebook’s Features** like Stories, Live videos, or Groups to increase engagement.
*   **Engage with Other Posts and Respond Promptly to Comments**. Facebook suggests replying within 24 hours.
*   **Understand Your Audience’s Preferences and Behaviors**, using analytics to align your social media strategy.
*   **Transform Your Best Reviews into Concise Facebook Posts** and tag the individuals who left them to enhance engagement and bring in new followers.
*   **Create Engaging Video Content**: Facebook offers various video formats, including Reels and Stories (shorter clips), as well as Facebook Videos on Demand and Live videos. Reels has emerged as Facebook’s most rapidly growing content format. Focus on crafting original and authentic videos that embody your brand’s unique voice. Optimize creative elements for mobile users, including vertical format, shorter and impactful text, clear overlays, and concise headlines. **Prioritize short-form videos (Reels) over static posts**.
*   **Don’t Forget the Basic Status Post**: Simple status posts (without photos, videos, or links) can be excellent for conveying straightforward information and securing high engagement levels.
*   **Put Ad Dollars Behind Your Most Impactful Content**: Boost or sponsor posts that already perform well organically. Ensure your content is engaging and relevant to your audience.
*   **Create content that encourages people to share via Messenger** (memes, insightful posts, relatable content). Prompt your audience to send posts to friends or discuss in group chats. **Private sharing (Messenger, WhatsApp, DMs) is now tracked as a ranking factor**.
*   **Posts that feel thoughtful, genuine, and relevant** are far more likely to get people to pause, react, or share.
*   Ask yourself, &#34;**Would people share my story with their friends or recommend it to others?**&#34; before publishing.
*   **Share posts that work on Facebook**: According to a 2024 Meta report, nearly 98% of viewed posts didn’t include a link. Most of what appears in feeds is content viewable without leaving the platform (reels, photos, carousels, text-based posts). Use links selectively and avoid linking to &#34;low-quality web experiences&#34;.
*   **Publish posts that create meaningful conversations**: Facebook likes authentic accounts that contribute to their community and help start or sustain thoughtful conversations.
*   The algorithm increasingly shows preference for content that is **authentic and showcases the human side of a brand**. Effective strategies include featuring employees or customers, using real photos, sharing behind-the-scenes content, telling personal stories, and interacting sincerely.
*   **A notable trend is the algorithm&#39;s increasing prioritization of content shared within Facebook Groups**. Posts within highly engaged Groups now have the potential for better visibility. Active participation in or building relevant Facebook Groups is becoming increasingly important.

### Facebook Algorithm Changes and Meta&#39;s Approach

*   In 2025, Facebook&#39;s algorithm updates focus on **AI-driven recommendations, deeper engagement metrics, and a shift toward meaningful interactions**.
*   Meta is aiming to have the world’s best recommendation technology by the end of 2026.
*   Meta is moving away from its third-party fact-checking program in the US and moving to a **Community Notes model**, similar to X, where the community decides when posts are potentially misleading and need more context.
*   Meta will allow **more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics** that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations.
*   They will take a **more personalized approach to political content**, so that people who want to see more of it in their feeds can.
*   Meta acknowledges over-enforcing rules and wants to undo the mission creep that has made rules too restrictive. They will rely more on user reports for less severe policy violations and require a much higher degree of confidence before content is taken down.
