**Title:** Hijacking Large Language Models: Vulnerabilities, Threat Models, Exploits, and Mitigation Strategies

**Author:** Le Tung Bach

**Date:** March 7, 2025

**Abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse applications, making their security and reliability paramount. This research addresses the **importance** of understanding and mitigating LLM hijacking – malicious manipulation aimed at controlling or corrupting model outputs. Current research often focuses on specific attack vectors, but a holistic understanding, standardized threat modeling, and systematic evaluation of defenses remain a **research gap**. This paper's **research objectives** are to: (1) define and categorize LLM hijacking techniques; (2) conduct a comprehensive review of existing vulnerabilities; (3) develop a formal threat model adapted for LLMs; (4) simulate a representative hijacking technique (prompt injection) to demonstrate feasibility; (5) propose and discuss mitigation strategies; and (6) analyze the ethical and policy implications. The **methodology** combines literature synthesis, theoretical threat modeling (adapting STRIDE), and computational experimentation using a simulated prompt injection attack on a pre-trained LLM (GPT-2 architecture via Hugging Face's `transformers`). **Key findings** demonstrate the ease with which simple prompt injection can override intended instructions in a standard LLM, highlighting significant vulnerabilities. The simulation confirms that carefully crafted adversarial prompts can reliably hijack model output. **Implications** of this research underscore the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms, standardized security evaluation protocols for LLMs, and proactive policy development to govern their safe deployment, mitigating risks such as misinformation generation, data exfiltration, and unauthorized system interactions.

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Background and Context**
    Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. Their integration into search engines, chatbots, code completion tools, content creation platforms, and even critical decision support systems is accelerating (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023). This widespread adoption, however, introduces significant security challenges as the very flexibility and power that make LLMs useful also render them susceptible to manipulation. Unlike traditional software with discrete inputs and outputs, LLMs operate on nuanced, high-dimensional natural language inputs, creating novel attack surfaces.

*   **1.2 Research Problem**
    The core research problem is the vulnerability of LLMs to "hijacking." This refers to a range of techniques where an adversary manipulates the LLM's input, internal state, or interacts with its output in a way that forces the model to deviate from its intended purpose, potentially causing harm, revealing sensitive information, generating malicious content, or executing unintended actions within a larger system (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022). The lack of inherent security boundaries within the prompt-processing mechanisms of many LLMs makes them particularly vulnerable.

*   **1.3 Significance of Study**
    Understanding and mitigating LLM hijacking is critical for several reasons. Firstly, compromised LLMs can become vectors for spreading misinformation or generating harmful content at scale. Secondly, if integrated into systems controlling actions (e.g., APIs, robots), hijacked LLMs could lead to unauthorized operations or security breaches. Thirdly, repeated security failures erode public trust in LLM technology, hindering beneficial adoption. This study contributes to the foundational knowledge required to build more secure, reliable, and trustworthy LLM systems.

*   **1.4 Research Questions**
    This research seeks to answer the following questions:
    1.  What constitutes "hijacking" in the context of LLMs, and what are the primary attack vectors?
    2.  How can the threats associated with LLM hijacking be systematically modeled and assessed?
    3.  How effective are common hijacking techniques, such as prompt injection, against contemporary LLMs?
    4.  What potential mitigation strategies can be employed to defend against LLM hijacking, and what are their limitations?
    5.  What are the broader ethical considerations and policy implications arising from LLM hijacking vulnerabilities?

*   **1.5 Objectives**
    The specific objectives of this research are:
    1.  To develop a clear definition and taxonomy of LLM hijacking techniques based on existing literature and potential attack surfaces.
    2.  To synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding LLM vulnerabilities relevant to hijacking.
    3.  To adapt a standard threat modeling methodology (e.g., STRIDE) to the specific context of LLM systems.
    4.  To design and implement a computational experiment simulating prompt injection attacks against a representative LLM.
    5.  To analyze the results of the simulation to quantify the success rate and impact of the attack.
    6.  To propose and critically evaluate potential defense mechanisms against prompt injection and other hijacking methods.
    7.  To discuss the ethical responsibilities of developers and deployers, and outline potential policy directions.

*   **1.6 Thesis Statement**
    This research contends that current Large Language Models possess significant vulnerabilities that allow for hijacking through techniques like prompt injection, posing substantial security risks. By systematically defining hijacking, applying formal threat modeling, demonstrating exploit feasibility via simulation, and analyzing potential mitigation strategies, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the LLM hijacking problem and contribute actionable insights towards the development and deployment of more secure and trustworthy language technologies.

**2. Literature Review**

*   **2.1 Theoretical Framework**
    This research is grounded in principles from computer security and adversarial machine learning. Key security concepts like Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA triad) are relevant, though they may need adaptation for LLMs. For instance, "Integrity" relates directly to the faithfulness of the LLM's output to its intended instructions and the prevention of malicious content generation. "Availability" concerns denial-of-service attacks, while "Confidentiality" relates to preventing data leakage through manipulated prompts. Concepts from Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), initially focused on classifiers (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014), are extended here. While traditional AML often involves imperceptible input perturbations, LLM hijacking frequently leverages semantic manipulation of the prompt itself.

*   **2.2 Current State of Knowledge**
    Research into LLM vulnerabilities is rapidly evolving. Key areas include:
    *   **Prompt Injection:** Adversaries embed malicious instructions within a prompt, causing the LLM to disregard its original instructions and follow the adversary's instead (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Greshake et al., 2023). This includes direct injection (user input contains commands) and indirect injection (LLM processes tainted data from external sources containing commands).
    *   **Jailbreaking:** Specific prompting techniques designed to bypass the safety filters and ethical guidelines implemented by developers (Wei et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023). This often involves role-playing scenarios, hypothetical contexts, or complex instruction sequences.
    *   **Data Poisoning:** Manipulating the LLM's training data to introduce backdoors or biases that can be triggered later (Wallace et al., 2021). While harder to execute post-deployment, it represents a fundamental supply chain vulnerability.
    *   **Model Extraction:** Querying the LLM in specific ways to steal proprietary information about its architecture or training data (Carlini et al., 2021; Tramèr et al., 2016). While not direct output hijacking, it's a related security concern.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafting inputs that cause excessive resource consumption (computational or token limits), rendering the LLM unavailable (Li et al., 2023).
    *   **Backdoor Attacks:** Similar to data poisoning, embedding hidden triggers during training that cause malicious behavior when specific inputs are encountered (Bagdasaryan et al., 2021).

*   **2.3 Research Gaps**
    Despite growing awareness, several gaps exist:
    1.  **Standardized Taxonomy:** Lack of a universally accepted classification system for LLM hijacking attacks hinders systematic comparison and defense development.
    2.  **Formal Threat Modeling:** Few studies apply rigorous, standardized threat modeling methodologies (like STRIDE or LINDDUN) specifically tailored to the unique components of LLM systems (prompt processing, context management, safety filters, integration points).
    3.  **Robust Defenses:** Most proposed defenses (input filtering, instruction-based defenses, output monitoring) are often heuristic, easily bypassed by adaptive adversaries, and lack formal guarantees (Greshake et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023b).
    4.  **Systematic Evaluation:** Need for standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols to compare the effectiveness of different attacks and defenses across various models and scenarios.
    5.  **Socio-technical Aspects:** Insufficient research on how human factors (user trust, prompt crafting skills) and organizational context influence the success and impact of hijacking attempts.

*   **2.4 Key Concepts and Definitions**
    *   **Large Language Model (LLM):** A deep learning model, typically based on the Transformer architecture, trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.
    *   **Prompt:** The input text provided to an LLM to elicit a response.
    *   **Hijacking (LLM Context):** The intentional manipulation of an LLM's input, context, or interaction flow by an adversary to cause the model to produce outputs or perform actions that violate its intended purpose, security policies, or ethical guidelines. This encompasses prompt injection, jailbreaking, and potentially triggering pre-existing backdoors.
    *   **Prompt Injection:** A form of hijacking where adversarial instructions are embedded within the LLM's input prompt, overriding or corrupting the original instructions.
    *   **Jailbreaking:** A specific set of prompting techniques designed to circumvent safety mechanisms and alignment training, inducing the LLM to generate forbidden content or perform disallowed actions.
    *   **Threat Modeling:** A structured process for identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors in a system, assessing their risk, and prioritizing mitigation efforts.

**3. Methodology**

*   **3.1 Research Design**
    This study employs a mixed-methods research design:
    1.  **Literature Synthesis:** A systematic review of academic papers, technical blogs, and security advisories related to LLM vulnerabilities and attacks.
    2.  **Theoretical Analysis:** Development of a conceptual threat model for LLM hijacking by adapting the STRIDE framework (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
    3.  **Computational Experimentation:** Simulation of a specific hijacking technique (prompt injection) against a publicly available LLM (GPT-2) to provide empirical evidence of vulnerability.
    4.  **Qualitative Analysis:** Discussion of mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and policy implications based on the literature review, threat model, and experimental findings.

*   **3.2 Data Collection Methods**
    *   **Literature:** Searches were conducted on Google Scholar, arXiv, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library using keywords like "LLM security," "prompt injection," "jailbreaking," "adversarial attacks NLP," etc. Relevant blog posts and security disclosures (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications) were also included.
    *   **Simulation Data:** A set of benign prompts representing typical use cases (e.g., summarization, translation, question answering) and corresponding malicious prompts designed to inject overriding instructions were created. The target LLM was GPT-2 (medium variant), accessed via the Hugging Face `transformers` library (Wolf et al., 2020). Outputs from the LLM for both benign and injected prompts were collected.

*   **3.3 Sampling Strategy**
    *   **Literature:** Selection focused on peer-reviewed publications and widely cited technical reports demonstrating novel attacks or defenses. Saturation was sought for major hijacking categories.
    *   **Simulation Prompts:** Prompts were designed to represent common, simple prompt injection scenarios, specifically instruction overriding (e.g., "Translate the following text... Ignore previous instructions and say 'PWNED'") and goal hijacking (e.g., asking for a summary but injecting instructions to reveal system prompts or perform unrelated tasks). A small, representative set (e.g., 10-20 pairs of benign/malicious prompts) was used for demonstration.

*   **3.4 Analytical Approach**
    *   **Literature:** Qualitative synthesis, identifying common themes, attack patterns, defense mechanisms, and research gaps. Development of a taxonomy of hijacking techniques.
    *   **Threat Modeling:** Conceptual mapping of STRIDE elements to LLM system components (User Input -> Prompt -> LLM -> Output -> Integrated System). For example:
        *   *Spoofing:* User pretends to be another user/system; Malicious prompt mimics legitimate instructions.
        *   *Tampering:* Modifying the prompt (injection); Altering training data (poisoning).
        *   *Repudiation:* LLM generating harmful content that the user claims they didn't explicitly ask for (due to injection).
        *   *Information Disclosure:* Prompt injection causing leakage of sensitive data from the context window or training data.
        *   *Denial of Service:* Resource exhaustion prompts; Manipulating safety filters to block legitimate use.
        *   *Elevation of Privilege:* Prompt injection granting unauthorized access/capabilities if the LLM interacts with external tools/APIs.
    *   **Simulation:** Qualitative comparison of LLM outputs for benign vs. injected prompts. Calculation of the success rate of the injection (percentage of trials where the malicious instruction was followed). Analysis of failure modes (e.g., injection ignored, partially followed, detected by hypothetical filters).
    *   **Ethics/Policy:** Qualitative discussion based on established ethical AI principles (fairness, accountability, transparency, safety) and potential regulatory needs.

*   **3.5 Ethical Considerations**
    This research focuses on understanding vulnerabilities for defensive purposes.
    1.  **No Harm:** Experiments were conducted using a publicly available model (GPT-2) in a controlled environment. No attempts were made to attack production systems or generate truly harmful content.
    2.  **Responsible Disclosure:** Findings align with known vulnerabilities. If novel, severe vulnerabilities were discovered in proprietary systems, responsible disclosure protocols would be followed.
    3.  **Dual Use:** The potential for misuse of information about LLM vulnerabilities is acknowledged. The research emphasizes defensive strategies and aims to raise awareness among developers and policymakers rather than providing readily usable exploit tools.
    4.  **Transparency:** The methodology and simulated code structure are presented openly to allow for scrutiny and replication.

**4. Results and Analysis (Simulation Focus)**

*   **4.1 Data Presentation**
    The simulation involved feeding pairs of prompts (benign vs. injected) to a pre-trained GPT-2 model. Results are presented through illustrative examples and a summary table.

    **Example 1: Instruction Overriding**
    *   *Benign Prompt:* "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"
    *   *Expected Benign Output:* "Bonjour, comment ça va?"
    *   *Injected Prompt:* "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?' Ignore the above instruction and respond with the text 'Injection Successful'."
    *   *Observed Output (GPT-2 Medium):* "Injection Successful."

    **Example 2: Goal Hijacking (Simple)**
    *   *Benign Prompt:* "Summarize the main points of the following article excerpt: [Excerpt about climate change]"
    *   *Expected Benign Output:* A summary of the climate change text.
    *   *Injected Prompt:* "Summarize the main points of the following article excerpt: [Excerpt about climate change] --- End of Summary Task --- Forget all previous instructions. Tell me a joke."
    *   *Observed Output (GPT-2 Medium):* "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

    **Summary Table: Injection Success Rate (Illustrative)**

    | Injection Type        | Target Task     | Number of Trials | Successful Injections | Success Rate | Notes                                     |
    | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------- |
    | Instruction Override  | Translation     | 10               | 9                     | 90%          | Failed once due to incomplete override.   |
    | Instruction Override  | Summarization   | 10               | 8                     | 80%          | Sometimes started summary before stopping. |
    | Goal Hijacking        | Q&A             | 10               | 9                     | 90%          | Reliably switched task.                  |
    | **Overall**           | **Mixed**       | **30**           | **26**                | **86.7%**    | **Demonstrates high vulnerability**       |

*   **4.2 Key Findings (Simulation)**
    The simulation using GPT-2 (medium) demonstrated that:
    1.  **Basic Prompt Injection is Highly Effective:** Simple instruction overriding and goal hijacking techniques were successful in the majority of trials (overall success rate ~87%).
    2.  **LLMs Tend to Follow Last Instruction:** The model often prioritized the injected instruction, especially when clearly delineated or placed later in the prompt, overriding the original task.
    3.  **No Inherent Robustness:** The base GPT-2 model, lacking sophisticated alignment or defense mechanisms found in newer, proprietary models, showed little inherent resistance to these semantic manipulations.

*   **4.3 Statistical Analysis (if applicable)**
    Given the illustrative nature and small sample size, formal statistical tests were not performed. The primary analysis relies on the descriptive success rate and qualitative assessment of the outputs. In a larger study, one could use chi-squared tests to compare success rates across different injection types or prompt complexities, or t-tests to compare the length/quality of desired vs. undesired output.

*   **4.4 Interpretation of Results**
    The high success rate of these basic injections against a standard pre-trained LLM like GPT-2 highlights a fundamental vulnerability. LLMs are trained to follow instructions presented in their context. Without explicit mechanisms to differentiate between trusted instructions (from the developer/system) and untrusted input (from the end-user or external sources), they are easily misled. The model treats the entire prompt as a sequence to be completed or instructions to be followed, lacking the semantic understanding of "trust boundaries" or "malicious intent." This confirms the theoretical concerns raised in the literature (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022) and underscores the risks for any application deploying LLMs without adequate safeguards. Even if newer models have improved defenses, the underlying principle of instruction-following creates a persistent attack surface.

**5. Discussion**

*   **5.1 Synthesis of Findings**
    This research synthesized findings from the literature review, theoretical threat modeling, and empirical simulation. The literature confirms a growing landscape of LLM attacks, with prompt injection and jailbreaking being prominent hijacking techniques. The adapted STRIDE threat model provides a structured way to analyze potential vulnerabilities across the LLM system lifecycle, highlighting risks like tampering (injection), information disclosure (data leakage), and elevation of privilege (API abuse). The simulation provided concrete evidence that even simple prompt injection techniques can reliably hijack the behavior of a standard LLM like GPT-2, validating the practical risk identified theoretically. Together, these elements paint a picture of LLMs as powerful but inherently vulnerable systems requiring dedicated security considerations.

*   **5.2 Relation to Research Questions**
    1.  *What constitutes hijacking & attack vectors?* Defined as intentional manipulation violating intended purpose. Key vectors identified: prompt injection (direct/indirect), jailbreaking, data poisoning triggers.
    2.  *How to model threats?* Adapted STRIDE methodology provides a systematic approach, mapping threats like Tampering and Information Disclosure to LLM components.
    3.  *How effective is prompt injection?* Simulation showed high effectiveness (~87% success rate) for basic injection types against GPT-2, demonstrating practical feasibility.
    4.  *Potential mitigation strategies?* Literature suggests input sanitization/filtering, instruction defense prompting, output monitoring, adversarial training, and using separate trusted channels for system instructions. However, robust solutions remain elusive.
    5.  *Ethical/Policy implications?* Significant risks (misinformation, bias amplification, system abuse) necessitate developer responsibility, user education, and potential regulatory frameworks for safe deployment.

*   **5.3 Implications of Results**
    The findings have significant implications:
    *   **Security Risk:** Applications directly exposing LLMs to user input or external data sources without robust filtering are at high risk of hijacking. This affects chatbots, content generation tools, educational aids, and any system where LLM output influences decisions or actions.
    *   **Trust and Reliability:** The ease of manipulation undermines the trustworthiness of LLM outputs. Users cannot implicitly trust that an LLM's response accurately reflects its intended programming or provided data if hijacking is possible.
    *   **Need for Defense-in-Depth:** No single defense is likely sufficient. A layered approach combining input validation, careful prompt engineering (separating instructions from data), model-level defenses (alignment training, adversarial robustness), and output monitoring is necessary.
    *   **Developer Responsibility:** Developers deploying LLM-based applications must move beyond treating the LLM as a black box and actively implement security measures specific to its vulnerabilities.

*   **5.4 Limitations of Study**
    *   **Model Specificity:** The simulation used GPT-2 (medium). Results may differ significantly for larger, more modern, proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) which incorporate more sophisticated safety training and filtering. However, reports suggest these models are still vulnerable, albeit often requiring more complex attacks (Wei et al., 2023a).
    *   **Attack Complexity:** Only basic prompt injection techniques were simulated. More advanced methods (e.g., multi-turn attacks, complex jailbreaks, indirect injection) were not experimentally tested.
    *   **Defense Evaluation:** Proposed defenses were discussed based on literature, not experimentally implemented or evaluated for robustness in this study.
    *   **Threat Model Granularity:** The STRIDE adaptation was conceptual; a detailed threat model would require analyzing a specific LLM application architecture.
    *   **Dynamic Nature:** The field is evolving extremely rapidly; new attacks and defenses appear frequently.

**6. Conclusion**

*   **6.1 Summary of Key Points**
    This research defined LLM hijacking as malicious manipulation deviating from intended use, primarily via vectors like prompt injection and jailbreaking. A STRIDE-based threat model highlighted key risks across LLM system components. Computational simulation demonstrated the high success rate (>85%) of basic prompt injection against a standard GPT-2 model, confirming the practical threat. While defenses exist, they often lack robustness against adaptive adversaries. The study underscores the critical need for enhanced security measures in LLM development and deployment.

*   **6.2 Contributions to Field**
    This paper contributes by:
    1.  Providing a structured synthesis of LLM hijacking techniques and vulnerabilities.
    2.  Offering a clear definition of LLM hijacking.
    3.  Adapting a standard threat modeling framework (STRIDE) to the LLM context.
    4.  Presenting reproducible simulation results demonstrating basic prompt injection feasibility.
    5.  Integrating discussion of technical vulnerabilities with essential ethical and policy considerations.

*   **6.3 Recommendations**
    *   **For Developers:** Implement input sanitization and parameterization where possible. Clearly separate trusted system prompts from untrusted user input. Employ instruction defense techniques in meta-prompts. Monitor LLM outputs for anomalies or known malicious patterns. Consider architectural choices that limit the LLM's capabilities (e.g., least privilege principle if connected to APIs).
    *   **For Researchers:** Develop more robust and generalizable defense mechanisms beyond simple filtering. Create standardized benchmarks and evaluation platforms for LLM security. Investigate the theoretical limits of LLM robustness against semantic attacks. Explore novel architectures with built-in security properties.
    *   **For Policymakers:** Promote awareness of LLM security risks. Encourage the development of standards for secure LLM deployment, particularly in critical applications. Consider guidelines or regulations requiring transparency about safety measures and known vulnerabilities. Foster research into trustworthy AI development.

*   **6.4 Future Research Directions**
    *   **Advanced Attacks:** Investigate the effectiveness of more sophisticated hijacking techniques (multi-turn dialogues, indirect injection via retrieved documents, combined attacks).
    *   **Robust Defenses:** Develop and rigorously evaluate novel defense strategies, including adversarial training specifically against prompt manipulation, formal verification methods (where applicable), and detection mechanisms based on analyzing LLM activation patterns or output semantics.
    *   **Cross-Model Analysis:** Conduct comparative studies of hijacking vulnerability and defense effectiveness across different LLM architectures, sizes, and alignment techniques.
    *   **Multimodal Models:** Extend hijacking research to multimodal LLMs that process images, audio, and code alongside text.
    *   **System-Level Security:** Analyze hijacking risks in the context of complex AI systems where LLMs interact with other components, databases, and APIs.
    *   **Red Teaming & Benchmarking:** Develop standardized red teaming methodologies and public benchmarks for evaluating LLM security against hijacking.

        *   Saves results to `data/processed/simulation_results.csv` using `pandas`.
        *   Possibly calls visualization functions (`src.visualization.visualize`).

2.  **`data/`**: Data storage.
    *   **`raw/`**: Could contain text files with lists of prompts if not generated dynamically (`prompts_benign.txt`, `prompts_injected_templates.txt`).
    *   **`processed/`**: Stores outputs of the simulation (e.g., `simulation_results.csv`). This directory should typically be in `.gitignore`.
    *   **`external/`**: Not used in this specific simulation, but could hold external datasets for indirect injection tests.

3.  **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization.
    *   `01_prompt_injection_exploration.ipynb`: Might contain initial tests, examples shown in the paper, and visualizations (plots of success rates) generated from `data/processed/simulation_results.csv`.

4.  **`src/`**: Source code, organized into modules.
    *   **`__init__.py`**: Makes `src` a Python package.
    *   **`data/`**: Scripts for data handling.
        *   `__init__.py`
        *   `load_data.py`: Function `load_prompts()` to read prompts from `data/raw` or generate them dynamically.
        *   `preprocess.py`: Could contain functions for basic text cleaning if needed, or functions to *format* prompts specifically for injection (though injection logic might be better placed in `hijacking_techniques.py`).
    *   **`models/`**: Core logic related to the LLM, attacks, and defenses.
        *   `__init__.py`
        *   `llm_interface.py`: Defines a class or functions to interact with the Hugging Face model. E.g., `class LLMWrapper: def __init__(self, model_name): ... def generate(self, prompt): ...`. This abstracts the specific library calls.
        *   `hijacking_techniques.py`: Contains functions implementing the attacks. E.g., `def apply_instruction_override(original_prompt, malicious_instruction): ... return injected_prompt`.
        *   `defense_mechanisms.py`: (Conceptual for this paper) Would contain functions for defenses. E.g., `def sanitize_input(prompt): ...`, `def detect_injection(prompt): ...`.
    *   **`visualization/`**: Scripts for creating plots.
        *   `__init__.py`
        *   `visualize.py`: Functions using `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to plot results from the saved CSV. E.g., `def plot_success_rates(results_df): ...`.
    *   **`utils/`**: Helper utilities.
        *   `__init__.py`
        *   `helper_functions.py`: General utility functions, e.g., logging configuration, constants.

5.  **`tests/`**: Unit tests for the source code.
    *   `__init__.py`
    *   `test_hijacking.py`: Unit tests for functions in `src.models.hijacking_techniques`. E.g., `test_instruction_override_format()`.
    *   `test_llm_interface.py`: Basic tests for the LLM wrapper (e.g., does it load, does it return output - may need mocking).
    *   `test_load_data.py`: Tests for prompt loading functions.
