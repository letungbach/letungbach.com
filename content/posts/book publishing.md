Wikimedia Commons does not provide ISBNs for ebooks or books, as it is primarily a platform for sharing free media files like images, videos, and audio under open licenses.

If you're looking to publish your book and obtain a free ISBN, here are some platforms that can help:

1. **Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP)**: Offers free ISBNs for ebooks and print books. It's a popular choice for self-publishing.
2. **IngramSpark**: Provides free ISBNs for U.S.-based self-publishers.
3. **Pencil**: A self-publishing platform that generates free ISBNs for your book and distributes it globally in ebook and paperback formats.
4. **Draft2Digital**: A user-friendly platform for publishing ebooks with free ISBNs.

These platforms not only provide ISBNs but also help distribute your book to major retailers. Let me know if you'd like more details about any of these options!
