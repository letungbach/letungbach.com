### Royal Unibrew's AI Integration: A New Era of Workplace Collaboration

Denmark's Royal Unibrew, the country's second-largest brewer, has taken a bold step into the future of work by introducing five AI 'colleagues' to its human workforce. This innovative approach, developed in partnership with Danish company Manifold AI, aims to enhance productivity and unleash the full potential of its staff [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).

### Meet the AI Team

The AI team consists of five virtual employees, each with a specific role:

1. KondiKai: Brand specialist
2. Athena: Market analyst
3. Prometheus: Sales data gatherer
4. Moller: Sommelier specializing in food and beer pairing
5. Ella: Trade specialist

These AI 'colleagues' have been given names, faces, backstories, and even the ability to change outfits. They interact daily with human employees through chats and emails, creating a unique hybrid work environment [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).

### Enhancing Human Potential

Michala Svane, Royal Unibrew's marketing director, emphasizes that the integration of AI colleagues is designed to complement human strengths. "What we as humans are good at is our creativity, our empathy, our knowledge of our customers," she explains. The AI assistants help with routine-based work and information gathering, allowing human employees to focus on more creative and empathetic tasks [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).

### Increased Engagement and Efficiency

The company has observed a significant increase in engagement since personalizing the AI agents. Svane notes, "When we put a picture on the AI agent, the use and the engagement went up times four" [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html). This personalization has led to improved collaboration between human and AI team members.

Karin Jorgensen, who heads the data collection and analysis team, reports increased agility and speed in their work processes. She interacts daily with Athena, her AI "sparring partner," for market analysis and report compilation. The AI assistance has allowed the company to keep more analysis and information collation in-house, increasing overall efficiency [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).

### Challenges and Considerations

While the integration of AI colleagues has brought numerous benefits, it also raises important questions about the future of work. Jan Damsgaard, a professor specializing in digital transformations at Copenhagen Business School, points out potential risks:

1. The nature of human-AI interactions in a professional setting
2. The impact on workplace dynamics when an AI becomes a close collaborator
3. Resolving conflicts between human and AI co-workers [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html)

Lise Knuppert Hordam, a manager at Royal Unibrew, emphasizes the importance of maintaining critical thinking skills when working with AI. She advises employees to approach AI-generated information with a discerning eye, recognizing that while based on valid data, it still requires human touch and creative thinking [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).

### Looking Ahead

As Royal Unibrew continues to develop this hybrid team of humans and AI co-workers, the company is laying the groundwork for a new model of workplace collaboration. The success of this initiative could pave the way for similar integrations across various industries, potentially reshaping the future of work on a global scale [1](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250415-danish-brewer-adds-ai-colleagues-to-human-team)[2](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/company-gives-ai-names-faces-backstories-even-work-emails-4874382.html).
