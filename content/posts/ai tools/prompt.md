Create a comprehensive, step-by-step guide detailing all available methods (both technical and non-technical) to scrape or crawl data from Facebook, including public and private data. A detailed, well-structured document or guide with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and examples. The guide should cover technical considerations, tools, techniques, and potential risks.

1. Overview of Facebook data scraping/crawling.
Facebook’s Terms of Service and Community Standards.

2. Types of Facebook Data
Public data (e.g., public posts, pages, groups).
Private data (e.g., private profiles, messages, friend lists).
Metadata (e.g., likes, shares, comments, timestamps).
Methods for Scraping Public Facebook Data

3. Manual Methods
Copy-pasting data.
Saving posts or pages as PDFs.
Automated Methods
Using Facebook Graph API (official method).
Web scraping with tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium.
Browser extensions for data extraction.
Third-party tools (e.g., Octoparse, ParseHub).
Social Media Management Tools
Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social for public data analytics.
Methods for Scraping Private Facebook Data

4. Account Access Methods
Logging into a user’s account (with consent).
Using session cookies or tokens.
Social Engineering
Phishing or tricking users into sharing data.
Exploits and Vulnerabilities

Third-Party Apps and APIs
Apps with access to private data (requires user permission).
Advanced Techniques

5. Reverse Engineering Facebook’s API
Analyzing network requests to uncover hidden endpoints.
Using Proxies and VPNs
